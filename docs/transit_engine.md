### Transit Engine

The Transit engine is a type of secrets engine that is designed to handle cryptographic operations, such as encryption, decryption, signing, and verifying data, without storing the actual data. It is often used to provide encryption-as-a-service for applications, enabling them to securely process sensitive information without managing the cryptographic keys directly.

### Key Features

1. **Encryption and Decryption**: Applications can use the Transit engine to encrypt and decrypt data.
2. **Signing and Verifying**: It can be used to sign data and verify signatures.
3. **Key Management**: It manages the lifecycle of cryptographic keys, including key creation, rotation, and deletion.
4. **Key Derivation**: It supports key derivation to generate keys based on a single root key.

### Workflow

1. **Key Creation**: Create a cryptographic key that will be used for encryption, decryption, signing, and verification.
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt data using the created key.
3. **Decryption**: Decrypt data using the created key.
4. **Signing**: Sign data using the created key.
5. **Verifying**: Verify signatures using the created key.
6. **Key Rotation**: Rotate the cryptographic key periodically to ensure security.
7. **Key Deletion**: Delete cryptographic keys when they are no longer needed.

### Use Cases

- **Data Encryption**: Securely encrypt data before storing it in a database or sending it over a network.
- **Tokenization**: Replace sensitive data with a unique identifier (token) that can be mapped back to the original data.
- **Digital Signatures**: Sign documents or data to ensure authenticity and integrity.
- **Key Management**: Centralize and automate the management of cryptographic keys.

### How it works in CryptKeeper

In the context of CryptKeeper, the Transit engine will be implemented as an engine type for paths. When a path is designated as a Transit engine, it will offer cryptographic services for data stored under that path.

### Example Implementation

#### 1. Key Creation
- Endpoint: `/transit/keys`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-key",
    "type": "aes256-gcm96"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "key_id": "my-key",
    "creation_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

#### 2. Encryption
- Endpoint: `/transit/encrypt`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "key_id": "my-key",
    "plaintext": "base64-encoded-plaintext"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "ciphertext": "base64-encoded-ciphertext"
  }
  ```

#### 3. Decryption
- Endpoint: `/transit/decrypt`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "key_id": "my-key",
    "ciphertext": "base64-encoded-ciphertext"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "plaintext": "base64-encoded-plaintext"
  }
  ```

#### 4. Signing
- Endpoint: `/transit/sign`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "key_id": "my-key",
    "message": "base64-encoded-message"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "signature": "base64-encoded-signature"
  }
  ```

#### 5. Verifying
- Endpoint: `/transit/verify`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "key_id": "my-key",
    "message": "base64-encoded-message",
    "signature": "base64-encoded-signature"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "valid": true
  }
  ```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Database Schema**: Add tables for storing cryptographic keys and their metadata.
2. **API Endpoints**: Implement the API endpoints for key management, encryption, decryption, signing, and verification.
3. **Engine Initialization**: Add logic to initialize paths with the Transit engine type.
4. **Key Rotation**: Implement key rotation functionality to periodically rotate cryptographic keys.
5. **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users and groups can perform cryptographic operations on the designated paths.

By following these steps, CryptKeeper can provide robust cryptographic services to its users, leveraging the Transit engine for secure data processing.
